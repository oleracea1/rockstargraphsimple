## Setup for IT-Rockstar GraphQL 🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇

I suggest using the package manager 'nvm'.

Use node v18.19.0 (npm v10.2.3)
-> make sure to run the right node version (`nvm use 18`)

In the project directory make sure to run amplify init to create your AWS-access with your credentials.

## Development Server

Run 'npm run dev' to start your local development-server. (Usually: http://localhost:3000/)

## Play

Have fun creating your own music database!
