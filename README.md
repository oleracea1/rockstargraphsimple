## Setup for IT-Rockstar GraphQL 
🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇🎸🥁🪘🥇

- I suggest using the package manager `nvm`.

- Use `node v18.19.0` (`npm v10.2.3`) for dependency-compatibility by running `nvm use 18`.

- In the project directory:
    - run `amplify init` to create AWS-access with your credentials.
    - run `npm install` to install all the neccesary dependencies.


## Development Server

- Run `npm run dev` to start your local development-server. (Usually: `http://localhost:3000/`)

## Using different environments (dev, preview, www)

- Run `amplify env add` to add a new environment (f.e. "preview" or "www")
- Run `amplify init` and choose to initialize the newly created environment
- Run `amplify push` to push the newly created environment

## Play

- Have fun creating your own music database!
